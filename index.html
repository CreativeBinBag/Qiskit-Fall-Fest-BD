                        <h4>The Physical Life of a Qubit</h4>
                        <p>Alongside fascinating talks on quantum algorithms and their applications, this session will look at the other side of the coin: the physical hardware. What is physically happening inside the machine to make a quantum computation possible? This talk aims to help demystify that process. We'll start by briefly looking at the basic physics that makes superconducting qubits work, touching on the recent experiments that won the Nobel Prize. Then, we'll take a practical look at the hardware itself, from the large dilution refrigerators to the microscopic superconducting chips inside. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The main goal is to connect the idea of a comp utation to the physical controls. We'll trace how a fundamental operation, like a 'X' gate, gets translated into a specific microwave pulse that "talks" to the qubit. We'll also discuss some of the challenges experimentalists face in the real world, and how these challenges are the reason for the noise and errors that can happen in a calculation. This talk is for anyone curious about hardware, and I hope it provides a helpful perspective on how the ideas of quantum computing and the physical hardware fit together.

                        <h4>From Quantum Gates to Weak Traces and Annealers</h4>
                        <p>Shushmi's interest in quantum computing began in her final year of high school, when she was selected to participate in the first cohort of the IBM-sponsored QxQ course(2020–2021). After this early exposure to quantum protocols and algorithms through Qiskit, her quantum journey took her from the bustling port city of Chittagong, Bangladesh, to the stone-lined streets of the University of Glasgow. As an undergraduate in 2022, under mentorship from Dr. Léo Bourdet at Microsoft Quantum, she explored quantum simulation of phenomena like the butterfly effect and tunnelling. Later, during her BSc project with Prof. Jörg Götte , she looked into more foundational aspects of quantum theory using the path-integral approach to study weak values in an interferometer, culminating in a prize winning final thesis. Central to this work was the time-symmetric reformulation of quantum mechanics, which characterises a quantum state using both pre- and post-selected boundary conditions, a framework more widely known as the two-state vector formalism. Going into her first-year as PhD student, she tackled advanced benchmarking of quantum annealers, which are analog quantum computers where the system evolves adiabatically to stay close to a ground state encoding solutions to problems. Looking ahead, now as a 2nd year PhD student, her project with Prof. Viv Kendon and Prof. Jonathan Pritchard aims to develop quantum approaches for tackling practical computational problems which leverage capabilities inherent to neutral-atom platforms, such as reconfigurable qubit layouts. Through these projects and continued exposure to quantum theory, computation, and experiment, she has come to realise that Physics not only deepens our understanding of the universe but also drives technological innovations. The recent Nobel Prize awarded to quantum physicists for advancements in superconducting circuits, a hallmark of the ongoing second Quantum Revolution (also termed as Quantum 2.0), is a powerful testament to this. In her talk, she will share more about her quest continuing to explore how quantum mechanics can be harnessed to solve complex problems and uncover new frontiers of understanding..</p>
